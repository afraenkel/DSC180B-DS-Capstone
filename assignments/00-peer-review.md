# Participation: peer-reviews

After each assignment, you will be randomly assigned another student's
work to peer-review:

-   For the project proposal, project checkpoints, and
    long-presentation, you will be assigned another group's work
    within your domain.

-   For the visual presentation and elevator pitch, you will be
    assigned another group's work outside your domain.

The specific questions to be answered in your peer reviews are
included at the end of each assignment.
