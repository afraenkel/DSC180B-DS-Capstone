# Participation: weekly check-in

Every week, each group must get together to update each other on the
week's progress. By Tuesdays 11:59PM PDT, the group must submit a
written submission answering the following questions:

-   What tasks from the previous week's to-do list were attempted
    (noting who attempted what task).

-   From those attempted tasks, which were completed? If they weren't
    completed, what percentage of each task was completed?

-   What difficulties or obstacles were encountered in the tasks you
    attempted?

-   What tasks will you be attempting in the next week and why? (note
    who will be attempting each task).

Each group member must be prepared to represent their entire group for
the weekly check-in during discussion section Wednesday
