## The 'Getting Started' assignment

### Due Date: Sunday 4/5 11:59PM

The first assignment sets up initial project details and
infrastructure for your work throughout the quarter. This consists of:

-   Revising your project proposal (adding specificity and
    incorporating comments).

-   Revising the schedule in your project proposal, adding
    specificity. Include the tasks that each individual will work on
    through project-checkpoint-1.

-   Creating a 'backlog' of specific tasks that will serve as a rubric
    for project checkpoint #1.

-   Create a *public* project GitHub repository following the project template
    from 180A. Create empty 'placeholder' files and directories (to
    commit an empty directory to git, you need to include an empty
    file in it -- `.gitkeep` is a common choice). Be sure to include a
    sensible `.gitignore` for your project.

### Submission Instructions

This assignment requires one submission per group.

-   Submit the project proposal and schedule on Canvas/Turnitin.
-   Submit the code to Gradescope via GitHub.

### Peer Review

After submitting this assignment, each individual will be assigned a
different group's proposal to peer review, due **Tuesday 4/7
11:59PM**. The peer review will be turned in on Canvas.
