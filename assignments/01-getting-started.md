### The 'Getting Started' assignment

The first assignment sets up initial project details and
infrastructure for your work throughout the quarter. This consists of:

-   Revising your project proposal (adding specificity and
    incorporating comments).

-   Revising the schedule in your project proposal, adding
    specificity. Include the tasks that each individual will work on
    through project-checkpoint-1.

-   Creating a 'backlog' of specific tasks that will serve as a rubric
    for project checkpoint #1.

-   Create a project GitHub repository following the project template
    from 180A.
