# Project Checkpoints (3x)

[[TO BE COMPLETED]]

-   Each project checkpoint is taken from the proposal
    schedule. Students can create their own rubric on which to be
    graded, or choose the default (e.g. data ingestion; EDA)

-   Each project checkpoint needs individual level tasks alongside
    group-wide ones (so not all grading is group-level).

-   After each project checkpoint, the proposal/schedule can be
    revised based on current progress.
