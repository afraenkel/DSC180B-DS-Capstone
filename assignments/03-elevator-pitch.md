### Elevator Pitch

The elevator pitch is a < 2 minute project pitch that motivates the
problem and summarizes the approach. The pitch should convince the
audience the problem is worth pursuing and contain just enough detail
to make it clear what the project involves. The pitch is due once work
on the project has begun (and the plan-of-action is stable), but
before results have been obtained. The elevator pitches from 180A will
be discussed before reworking them.
