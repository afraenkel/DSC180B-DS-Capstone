### Elevator Pitch (Due Tuesday May 5, 11:59PM)

The elevator pitch is a short (sub 2 minute) project pitch that motivates the
problem and summarizes the approach. The pitch should convince the
audience the problem is worth pursuing and contain just enough detail
to make it clear what the project involves. The pitch is due once work
on the project has begun (and the plan-of-action is stable), but
before results have been obtained.

Watch and read the lecture on oral communication before writing your
pitch. *You will be graded on a rubric reflecting the rules and
guidelines given in that lecture*. 

The pitch should follow the format of "Context / Complication /
Question / Hypothesis". 

Each individual must record their own elevator pitch and upload it to
Canvas as an mp4 file.
