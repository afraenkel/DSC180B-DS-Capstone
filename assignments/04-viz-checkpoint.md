# Visual Presentation Checkpoint (Due Tue May 12 11:59PM)

The purpose of this assignment is to 
1. get the technology for your webpage started, and
2. carefully plan and organize the *purpose* and *overall content* of
   your webpage.

Set up GitHub pages and create a working "rough draft" of the
visual-presentation for your project. This page should allow your
intended audience to understand or interact with your project.

To set up your own page follow the tutorial on:
* https://kbroman.org/simple_site/

Pay particular attention to:
* https://kbroman.org/simple_site/pages/overview.html
* https://kbroman.org/simple_site/pages/independent_site.html
* https://github.com/kbroman/simple_site (code)


Turn in ~2 paragraphs that:
1. Specifies the URL of the webpage (the webpage only needs to load
   and contain an outline of the eventual material).
2. Describes the intended audience for the webpage (what background do
   they have? Domain? Technical? General Audience?).
3. Describes in detail two different visualizations that you will
   include on the webpage (what they describe / do; what purpose they
   serve). Be as specific as possible.
4. Summarizes the outline of the webpage.

Turn in a sketch of your webpage, including the visualizations and
outline described above. This can either be included in the document
above, or submitted as an image file alongside the document above.
