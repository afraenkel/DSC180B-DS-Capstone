# Long Presentation

The 'long presentation' is a 15 minute, slide-based presentation aimed
at a semi-technical audience. The group should split the presentation
up between all individuals. The content breakdown of the presentation
should be:

-   Non-technical introduction to the problem at-hand (25%)

-   Description of approach taken, getting increasingly technical
    (50%)

-   Results, possible further work, and conclusion (25%)

See the lecture on effective presentations for reference.

### To turn in:

* You must turn your slides into gradescope *before* Discussion
  section on week 9.
  
* Your presentation will be given 'live' (over Zoom) to your
  discussion section in week 9.
  
* You must record a version of your presentation and submit the
  recording to Canvas by the end of week 9. This presentation is
  different than your 'live' presentation (e.g. a rehearsal). You may
  create an mp4 recording by hosting a Zoom meeting among your group
  and record the meeting to your computer.
