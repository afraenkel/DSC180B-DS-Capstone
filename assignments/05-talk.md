# Long Presentation

The 'long presentation' is a 20 minute, slide-based presentation aimed
at a semi-technical audience. The group should split the presentation
up between all individuals. The content breakdown of the presentation
should be:

-   Non-technical introduction to the problem at-hand (25%)

-   Description of approach taken, getting increasingly technical
    (50%)

-   Results, possible further work, and conclusion (25%)

See the lecture on effective presentations for reference.
