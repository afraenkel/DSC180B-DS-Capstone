# Visual Presentation

[[TO BE COMPLETED]]

The visual presentation should allow people to understand and interact
with the output of your project through visual media and written
content. This content should be largely accessible to a general
audience. Examples of visual presentation include, but are not limited
to:

-   A (long-form) blog post, hosted on GitHub pages or a local
    web-server.

-   A gallery of visual content representing the output of the
    project.

-   A website or app (with a frontend) that provides a service or tool
    with output generated by your project output.

The visual presentation can either be your primary or secondary form
of project output.

-   If the visual presentation is your primary output, then it must
    RUBRIC:XXXXXXX. In this case, the report turned in with the
    project artifact will consist of a basic summary of the process
    and results.

-   If the visual presentation is your secondary output, then it can
    merely provide a visual hook and summary for the project to a
    general audience. In this case, the report turned in with the
    project artifact will consist of a thorough, visually clear,
    scientific report.
