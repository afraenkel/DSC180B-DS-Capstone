### Final Project Artifact

[[TO BE COMPLETED]]

The final project artifact consists of the project's code,
documentation, and written report. Details on the three components:

1.  Project code must follow best practices for the 'anatomy of a
    DS-project' from 180A.

2.  The project should have documentation for users and potential
    developers on the project. Such documentation should exist as
    narrative documentation, docstrings, and code comments where
    appropriate.

3.  The project artifact should include a written report introducing
    the project and summarizing/analyzing the results. The report is
    modeled after the result-replication report in 180A.
