DSC 180B Quick-Start Guide
==========================

This guide provides a summary and pointers to the necessary course
components in our remote setting. As this course is a continuation of
180A, you will likely already be familiar with many of the mechanisms
of the course delivery; this guide will focus on differences.

Required Services
-----------------

-   **Canvas** will serve as a central repository for all materials in the course. Grades will be kept up to date in Canvas and contain links to other course materials.

-   Coding assignments will be submitted to **Gradescope** via your group's project **GitHub** repository). Your gradescope is linked to the course Canvas.

-   Written reports will be submitted to **Turnitin** (linked through Canvas).

-   Project work will be worked on personal computing devices or the **DSMLP** Server. (Note: campus VPN is not required to use the DSMLP server).

-   Office hours, discussion section, and lab hours will be conducted via **Zoom**.

-   **Piazza** will be available for questions and course communication.

Be sure to test access to each of these services as soon as possible.

Adjusting to Remote Coursework amid COVID-19
--------------------------------------------

Under the circumstances of a rapidly changing public health emergency, we have had to forgo our usual campus life for hurried alternatives (quick returns to our families around the world, sheltering in our local apartments or dorm rooms). Many of us will be battling a variety of emotions in response to the quickly changing crisis (added stress or anxiety), spending significant time supporting our friends and family, all while trying to maintain focus on coursework.

-   If juggling these becomes difficult, please reach out to me -- either as it pertains to focusing on your coursework, or anything else.

-   Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) is available for support as well -- without hesitation, you should reach out by calling (858) 534-3755.

This quarter will take adjustment to find both physical and mental space to work. Please reach out to course staff if you would like to talk to someone about how to approach such adjustments!

Creating a Remote Environment for Work
--------------------------------------

Setting up a comfortable, quiet environment to work is important for success on your project. However, it's a reality that both students and staff will be working in spaces not necessarily set up as a work environment. As such, we all will endure and tolerate hiccups in both delivering and taking the course. Good communication  is the key to handling such hiccups.

-   If you are sharing a physical environment that regularly makes it difficult to do the required coursework or attend any required course component in real-time, please reach out to course staff early.

-   If you experience hiccups that make working difficult, share them early. Course staff and classmates may have helpful tips to solve or alleviate these problems. If such problems are affecting your ability to make a deadline, surfacing them early will help course staff accommodate you.

Success in this course requires working closely with your fellow group members. You are required to have regular meetings with your group. Consider using multiple modes of collaboration and communication with your groups, including audio-visual (e.g. via Zoom, Hangouts, etc), synchronous chat (Slack, Hangouts, Whatsapp, etc), and asynchronous chat/writing (Canvas Groups, Piazza, Google Docs, GitHub issues).

Course Components
-----------------

-   Lectures will be pre-recorded video that you may watch asynchronously. Lecture hours will be used as methodology-focused office hours.

-   Discussion section will be synchronously held; attendance is required. These will be held over Zoom and consist of giving project updates to instructors and classmates.

-   Lab Hours and OH will be held over Zoom (exact structure, TBD).

Course Deliverables
-------------------

You will turn in code and written reports throughout the quarter as you progress on your project (3 checkpoints and a final product), as well as present additional visual and oral presentations on your project. Smaller assignments include revisions to your project proposal, weekly check-ins, and peer-review submissions.
