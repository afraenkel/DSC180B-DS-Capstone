DSC 180B Syllabus
=================

In DSC 180B, you will execute on the project proposal you drafted with your group in DSC180A. This entails working closely with the group you formed last quarter to follow through on your idea, producing a complete project that includes:

-   A code repository that conforms to best practices in data science workflows,

-   A written report that summarizes and explains the output of the project,

-   Visual presentations of the material, aimed at general and technical audiences,

-   Oral presentations of the material, in varying length, and for different audiences.

Your group will work on the project openly as a part of your greater scholarly community (i.e. your section), contributing/receiving feedback to/from your peers. At the end of the quarter, you will be able to represent your project effectively to a diverse audience: possibly presenting it to the greater HDSI community, potential employers, family, and friends.

Course Components
-----------------

This course revolves around your work as a group and the deliverables your group produces. Regularly scheduled check-ins encourage steady, incremental progress without last-minute obstacles.

-   Lectures are pre-recorded videos that you may watch asynchronously. They will contain context, specifics, and standards to which your course assignments will be held.

-   Discussion section will be synchronously held; attendance is required. These will be held over Zoom and consist of giving project updates to instructors and classmates.

-   Lab Hours and OH will be held over Zoom from Canvas (exact structure, TBD).

The course deliverables are described below (with links to assignments therein):

-   Participation in the process of project development involves giving weekly updates in Discussion Section, submitting updates to Canvas, and giving assigned feedback to your peers.

-   Refining your group's proposal and schedule after each project checkpoint.

-   The project artifact consists of a code pipeline following the best practices outlined in the methodology portion of the course, documentation for users/developers, and a report summarizing the project and analyzing the results.

-   The project artifact includes 3 checkpoints similar to those in 180A.

-   A primary and secondary visual/written communication of your project.

-   The primary output will be held to a higher standard than the secondary output.

-   One of the modes must be a written report.

-   Example 1: Primary is a scientific paper, included in your artifact; secondary is a blog post explaining results/technique to a general audience with carefully presented visuals.

-   Example 2: Primary is a website with carefully done (perhaps interactive) visuals; Secondary is the basic written report included in the artifact that explains and analyzes the project results.

-   Two oral presentations:

-   An elevator pitch for a general audience

-   A longer slide-based presentation aimed at a technical audience.

Each assignment will be graded on an A/B/C/F scale, without the precision of plus/minus grades (A=4, B=3, C=2, F=0). The reason for this policy is twofold:

1.  Grading each project on the same scale, across domains, requires using broad guidelines for satisfactory work.

2.  Stripped of physical campus resources and space, the suitability of student work environments in this rushed delivery of remote instruction vary wildly. Such variability adds more noise in student output, which needs to be met with a decrease in grading precision.

Assignments will be graded using the following rubric:

|

A (4.0)

 |

Accomplishes the task accurately, completely, and clearly. Code is clear, effective, and efficient. Written component is concise, at the appropriate level, and correct. Oral component (when applicable) is effective both visually and explanation; is within the time limit.

 |
|

B (3.0)

 |

Accomplishes the task well, but lacks some completeness or clarity. Code runs but lacks some aspect of clarity, effectiveness, and or efficiency. Written component is logical and generally correct, but lacks either clarity or accuracy. Oral component (when applicable) is moderately effective and/or slightly outside the time window.

 |
|

C (2.0)

 |

The task is somewhat accomplished, but lacks significantly when it comes to completeness and clarity. Code present but does not accomplish the task up to the standards of a data science graduating senior. Written component lacks substantial clarity/correctness. Oral component (when applicable) significantly lacks effectiveness/clarity.

 |
|

F (0.0)

 |

The task largely remains unaccomplished. Code lacks completeness, structure, and is unclear. Written component lacking required information to understand what you did and/or your results. Oral component (when applicable) is nonsensical/unclear.

 |

Final grades will be computed using the grade-points above, using the proportions given in the course components table. Letter grades will be assigned using the standard university cutoffs.

### Grading: Group vs. Individual Work

Written assignments are in part graded against the rubric that each group creates in their project proposal, which specifies the tasks that each group member is responsible for. These written (and coded) assignments will be submitted with a list of the group members and the portions of the assignment each member completed.

Assignments will largely be graded uniformly as a group. However, if the balance of quality or quantity of work is significantly non-uniform, grades may be apportioned out individually.

Assignments
-----------

### Participation: weekly check-in

Every week, each group must get together to update each other on the week's progress. By Tuesdays 11:59PM PDT, the group must submit a written submission answering the following questions:

-   What tasks from the previous week's to-do list were attempted (noting who attempted what task).

-   From those attempted tasks, which were completed? If they weren't completed, what percentage of each task was completed?

-   What difficulties or obstacles were encountered in the tasks you attempted?

-   What tasks will you be attempting in the next week and why? (note who will be attempting each task).

Each group member must be prepared to represent their entire group for the weekly check-in during discussion section Wednesday

### Participation: peer-reviews

After each assignment, you will be randomly assigned another student's work to peer-review:

-   For the project proposal, project checkpoints, and long-presentation, you will be assigned another group's work within your domain.

-   For the visual presentation and elevator pitch, you will be assigned another group's work outside your domain.

The specific questions to be answered in your peer reviews are included at the end of each assignment.

### Project Checkpoints (3x)

[[TO COMPLETE]]

-   Each project checkpoint is taken from the proposal schedule. Students can create their own rubric on which to be graded, or choose the default (e.g. data ingestion; EDA)

-   Each project checkpoint needs individual level tasks alongside group-wide ones (so not all grading is group-level).

-   After each project checkpoint, the proposal/schedule can be revised based on current progress.

### Visual Presentation Checkpoint

...(1) set up code to host the content and (2) sketch an outline of the content...

### The 'Getting Started' assignment

The first assignment sets up initial project details and infrastructure for your work throughout the quarter. This consists of:

-   Revising your project proposal (adding specificity and incorporating comments).

-   Revising the schedule in your project proposal, adding specificity. Include the tasks that each individual will work on through project-checkpoint-1.

-   Creating a 'backlog' of specific tasks that will serve as a rubric for project checkpoint #1.

-   Create a project GitHub repository following the project template from 180A.

### Final Project Artifact

The final project artifact consists of the project's code, documentation, and written report. Details on the three components:

1.  Project code must follow best practices for the 'anatomy of a DS-project' from 180A.

2.  The project should have documentation for users and potential developers on the project. Such documentation should exist as narrative documentation, docstrings, and code comments where appropriate.

3.  The project artifact should include a written report introducing the project and summarizing/analyzing the results. The report is modeled after the result-replication report in 180A.

### Elevator Pitch

The elevator pitch is a < 2 minute project pitch that motivates the problem and summarizes the approach. The pitch should convince the audience the problem is worth pursuing and contain just enough detail to make it clear what the project involves. The pitch is due once work on the project has begun (and the plan-of-action is stable), but before results have been obtained. The elevator pitches from 180A will be discussed before reworking them.

### Long Presentation

The 'long presentation' is a 20 minute, slide-based presentation aimed at a semi-technical audience. The group should split the presentation up between all individuals. The content breakdown of the presentation should be:

-   Non-technical introduction to the problem at-hand (25%)

-   Description of approach taken, getting increasingly technical (50%)

-   Results, possible further work, and conclusion (25%)

See the lecture on effective presentations for reference.

### Visual Presentation

The visual presentation should allow people to understand and interact with the output of your project through visual media and written content. This content should be largely accessible to a general audience. Examples of visual presentation include, but are not limited to:

-   A (long-form) blog post, hosted on GitHub pages or a local web-server.

-   A gallery of visual content representing the output of the project.

-   A website or app (with a frontend) that provides a service or tool with output generated by your project output.

The visual presentation can either be your primary or secondary form of project output.

-   If the visual presentation is your primary output, then it must RUBRIC:XXXXXXX. In this case, the report turned in with the project artifact will consist of a basic summary of the process and results.

-   If the visual presentation is your secondary output, then it can merely provide a visual hook and summary for the project to a general audience. In this case, the report turned in with the project artifact will consist of a thorough, visually clear, scientific report.
