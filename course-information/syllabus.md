## Introduction <a name="Introduction"></a>

In DSC 180B, you will execute on the project proposal you drafted with
your group in DSC180A. This entails working closely with the group you
formed last quarter to follow through on your idea, producing a
complete project that includes:

-   A code repository that conforms to best practices in data science
    workflows,

-   A written report that summarizes and explains the output of the
    project,

-   Visual presentations of the material, aimed at general and
    technical audiences,

-   Oral presentations of the material, in varying length, and for
    different audiences.

Your group will work on the project openly as a part of your greater
scholarly community (i.e. your section), contributing/receiving
feedback to/from your peers. At the end of the quarter, you will be
able to represent your project effectively to a diverse audience:
possibly presenting it to the greater HDSI community, potential
employers, family, and friends.

## Course Components <a name="coursecomponents"></a>

This course revolves around your work as a group and the deliverables
your group produces. Regularly scheduled check-ins encourage steady,
incremental progress without last-minute obstacles.

-   **Lectures** are pre-recorded videos that you may watch
    asynchronously. They will contain context, specifics, and
    standards to which your course assignments will be held.

-   **Discussion** section will be synchronously held; attendance is
    required. These will be held over Zoom and consist of giving
    project updates to instructors and classmates.

-   **Lab Hours** and OH will be held over Zoom from Canvas (exact
    structure, TBD).

The course deliverables are described below (with links to assignments
therein):

-   Participation in the process of project development involves
    giving weekly updates in Discussion Section, submitting updates to
    Canvas, and giving assigned feedback to your peers.

-   Refining your group's proposal and schedule after each project
    checkpoint.

-   The project artifact consists of a code pipeline following the
    best practices outlined in the methodology portion of the course,
    documentation for users/developers, and a report summarizing the
    project and analyzing the results.

-   The project artifact includes 3 checkpoints similar to those in
    180A.

-   A primary and secondary visual/written communication of your
    project.

-   Two oral presentations: An elevator pitch for a general audience
    and a longer slide-based presentation aimed at a technical
    audience.

### Grading of course components <a name="componentgrading"></a>

|Component|Assignment|% of Grade|
|---|---|---|
|Participation (10%) |Weekly updates |5% |
|  |Peer Reviews |5% |
|Proposal (5%)|Refinements (3x) |5% |
|Project Artifact (30%) |Code Pipeline + Documentation |21% |
|  |Checkpoints (3x) |9% |
|Visual/Written Comm (40%) |Primary |20% |
|  |Secondary |12% |
|  |Checkpoints (4x) |8% |
|Oral Communication (15%) |Elevator Pitch |5% |
|  |Detailed Talk |10% |

Each assignment will be graded on an A/B/C/F scale, without the
precision of plus/minus grades (A=4, B=3, C=2, F=0). The reason for
this policy is twofold:

1.  Grading each project on the same scale, across domains, requires
    using broad guidelines for satisfactory work.

2.  Stripped of physical campus resources and space, the suitability
    of student work environments in this rushed delivery of remote
    instruction vary wildly. Such variability adds more noise in
    student output, which needs to be met with a decrease in grading
    precision.

### Grading rubric <a name="rubric"></a>

Assignments will be graded using the following rubric:

|Grade|Criteria|
|---|---|
|A (4.0) |Accomplishes the task accurately, completely, and clearly. Code is clear, effective, and efficient. Written component is concise, at the appropriate level, and correct. Oral component (when applicable) is effective both visually and explanation; is within the time limit. |
|B (3.0) |Accomplishes the task well, but lacks some completeness or clarity. Code runs but lacks some aspect of clarity, effectiveness, and or efficiency. Written component is logical and generally correct, but lacks either clarity or accuracy. Oral component (when applicable) is moderately effective and/or slightly outside the time window. |
|C (2.0) |The task is somewhat accomplished, but lacks significantly when it comes to completeness and clarity. Code present but does not accomplish the task up to the standards of a data science graduating senior. Written component lacks substantial clarity/correctness. Oral component (when applicable) significantly lacks effectiveness/clarity. |
|F (0.0) |The task largely remains unaccomplished. Code lacks completeness, structure, and is unclear. Written component lacking required information to understand what you did and/or your results. Oral component (when applicable) is nonsensical/unclear. |

Final grades will be computed using the grade-points above, using the
proportions given in the course components table. Letter grades will
be assigned using the standard university cutoffs.

### Grading: Group vs. Individual Work <a name="groupgrade"></a>

Written assignments are in part graded against the rubric that each
group creates in their project proposal, which specifies the tasks
that each group member is responsible for. These written (and coded)
assignments will be submitted with a list of the group members and the
portions of the assignment each member completed.

Assignments will largely be graded uniformly as a group. However, if
the balance of quality or quantity of work is significantly
non-uniform, grades may be apportioned out individually.

## Assignments and Due Dates <a name="duedates"></a>

## Working in Groups in Remote Environments <a name="groupenv"></a>

... a section on tips for working in groups in remote environments...

## Academic Integrity <a name="AI"></a>

In DSC 180, we expect you to work hard, act with integrity, and
accurately represent any work you produce as your own. The capstone
project is unusual for a DSC course, as all of the work you produce is
public and meant to be shown off to the world! However, this both
increases the likelihood of exposing such behavior, and magnifies the
consequences of any act of cheating or plagiarism:
-   If your work copied the analysis of a book, paper, article, or
    blog: the work’s author might notice and contact you, or a
    prospective employer might notice and pass on your job
    application.
-   If you copy the code of someone else: this may be noticed as
    above, or at the very least, you won’t be able to represent the
    code well when asked about its details (say, in a job interview).

In the course of your capstone project you are required to read,
understand, and incorporate others' work into your project; this is
how progress is made! However, you need to:
-   Always cite work when both directly quoting or
    paraphrasing/summarizing others’ work.
-   Always cite code in comments when using others’ code (even Stack
    Overflow).

We understand that understanding the line between building off of
others material and plagiarism takes practice. You are expected to try
your best by acting with integrity and err on the side of caution. All
reports will be turned in to Turnitin with the Similarity Matching
feature made visible to you; this transparency will help you to
improve the quality of your citations. You are also encouraged to ask
course staff for guidance, when unsure!

Of course, following the [UCSD Policy on Integrity of
Scholarship](http://academicintegrity.ucsd.edu/process/policy.html) is
required in this course. Ignorance of the rules will not excuse you
from any violations.


## Assignments <a name="assignments"></a>

### Participation: weekly check-in

Every week, each group must get together to update each other on the
week's progress. By Tuesdays 11:59PM PDT, the group must submit a
written submission answering the following questions:

-   What tasks from the previous week's to-do list were attempted
    (noting who attempted what task).

-   From those attempted tasks, which were completed? If they weren't
    completed, what percentage of each task was completed?

-   What difficulties or obstacles were encountered in the tasks you
    attempted?

-   What tasks will you be attempting in the next week and why? (note
    who will be attempting each task).

Each group member must be prepared to represent their entire group for
the weekly check-in during discussion section Wednesday

### Participation: peer-reviews

After each assignment, you will be randomly assigned another student's
work to peer-review:

-   For the project proposal, project checkpoints, and
    long-presentation, you will be assigned another group's work
    within your domain.

-   For the visual presentation and elevator pitch, you will be
    assigned another group's work outside your domain.

The specific questions to be answered in your peer reviews are
included at the end of each assignment.

### Project Checkpoints (3x)

[[TO COMPLETE]]

-   Each project checkpoint is taken from the proposal
    schedule. Students can create their own rubric on which to be
    graded, or choose the default (e.g. data ingestion; EDA)

-   Each project checkpoint needs individual level tasks alongside
    group-wide ones (so not all grading is group-level).

-   After each project checkpoint, the proposal/schedule can be
    revised based on current progress.

### Visual Presentation Checkpoint

...(1) set up code to host the content and (2) sketch an outline of
the content...

### The 'Getting Started' assignment

The first assignment sets up initial project details and
infrastructure for your work throughout the quarter. This consists of:

-   Revising your project proposal (adding specificity and
    incorporating comments).

-   Revising the schedule in your project proposal, adding
    specificity. Include the tasks that each individual will work on
    through project-checkpoint-1.

-   Creating a 'backlog' of specific tasks that will serve as a rubric
    for project checkpoint #1.

-   Create a project GitHub repository following the project template
    from 180A.

### Final Project Artifact

The final project artifact consists of the project's code,
documentation, and written report. Details on the three components:

1.  Project code must follow best practices for the 'anatomy of a
    DS-project' from 180A.

2.  The project should have documentation for users and potential
    developers on the project. Such documentation should exist as
    narrative documentation, docstrings, and code comments where
    appropriate.

3.  The project artifact should include a written report introducing
    the project and summarizing/analyzing the results. The report is
    modeled after the result-replication report in 180A.

### Elevator Pitch

The elevator pitch is a < 2 minute project pitch that motivates the
problem and summarizes the approach. The pitch should convince the
audience the problem is worth pursuing and contain just enough detail
to make it clear what the project involves. The pitch is due once work
on the project has begun (and the plan-of-action is stable), but
before results have been obtained. The elevator pitches from 180A will
be discussed before reworking them.

### Long Presentation

The 'long presentation' is a 20 minute, slide-based presentation aimed
at a semi-technical audience. The group should split the presentation
up between all individuals. The content breakdown of the presentation
should be:

-   Non-technical introduction to the problem at-hand (25%)

-   Description of approach taken, getting increasingly technical
    (50%)

-   Results, possible further work, and conclusion (25%)

See the lecture on effective presentations for reference.

### Visual Presentation

The visual presentation should allow people to understand and interact
with the output of your project through visual media and written
content. This content should be largely accessible to a general
audience. Examples of visual presentation include, but are not limited
to:

-   A (long-form) blog post, hosted on GitHub pages or a local
    web-server.

-   A gallery of visual content representing the output of the
    project.

-   A website or app (with a frontend) that provides a service or tool
    with output generated by your project output.

The visual presentation can either be your primary or secondary form
of project output.

-   If the visual presentation is your primary output, then it must
    RUBRIC:XXXXXXX. In this case, the report turned in with the
    project artifact will consist of a basic summary of the process
    and results.

-   If the visual presentation is your secondary output, then it can
    merely provide a visual hook and summary for the project to a
    general audience. In this case, the report turned in with the
    project artifact will consist of a thorough, visually clear,
    scientific report.
